## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-25 — *Resilient Convergence*

Production-grade data layer, refactored convergence wiring, and full UI parity
with the sibling **Pragyam** terminal.

### Added
- **Smart data layer.** Three production-grade primitives now sit between the
  app and every external API:
  - **Circuit breaker** (`data/circuit_breaker.py`) — `CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN`
    state machine per service, thread-safe, with two module-level breakers
    (`yfinance_circuit`, `sheets_circuit`) and a shared `all_circuits()` helper.
  - **Retry-with-backoff** — exponential decorator (1s → 2s → 4s, capped at 60s,
    max 3 retries), `@yfinance_circuit.protect` / `@RetryWithBackoff` stack.
  - **Two-tier cache** (`data/cache.py`, revived from dead code) — memory + disk,
    TTL expiry, **versioned keys** (`version="v1"` bump invalidates a namespace
    atomically), `get_stale()` last-good-snapshot fallback used automatically
    when a fetch fails *and* the circuit is open, full `stats()` snapshot
    (hits / misses / stale_hits / writes / hit_rate / namespace / TTL).
- **Data Layer Health diagnostics** — new section in the Diagnostics tab
  showing per-namespace cache hit rate, disk entry count, last-fetch
  timestamp, and per-service circuit-breaker state (CLOSED / HALF-OPEN / OPEN).
- **Global Macro bond-ETF universe.** Ported from the sibling **Sanket**
  project — 66 yfinance-available bond ETF tickers covering US Treasuries
  (full curve + raw yields ^IRX / ^FVX / ^TNX / ^TYX), TIPS, aggregate
  bonds, corporate IG / HY, mortgage-backed, municipals, developed-markets
  sovereign (Europe + Asia-Pacific), India fixed income, and emerging
  markets. Replaces the broken Stooq endpoints.
- **Shared normalisation module** (`convergence/normalization.py`) — single
  source of truth for the math behind the Convergence Analysis cards *and*
  the Unified Signal plot. Five small pure functions:
  `align_aarambh_nirnay`, `compute_norm_params`, `zscore_clip`,
  `classify_normalized_signal`, `compute_normalized_convergence`.
- **Pragyam-style UI uplift.** Full port of the *Obsidian Quant Terminal*
  design system from Pragyam:
  - `ui/theme.css` expanded from 47KB to 114KB — adds backdrop-filter glass,
    SVG noise + grid underlays, 11+ entrance / shimmer / gradient-shift
    keyframes, premium springy easing `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`,
    expanded palette (`--orange`, `--slate-warm`, `--card-base` DRY tokens).
  - `ui/components.py` expanded from 18KB to 27KB — new helpers
    `get_icon(name, size, stroke_width)` (dynamic-sized SVG), `get_signal_badge`
    (5-tier conviction badge), `render_conviction_signal`, `render_system_card`,
    `render_kv_table`. Icon library grew from 18 → 34.
  - Signal card design language unified with metric cards: corner accent dot
    + bottom gradient sweep + tinted background gradients per variant.
  - **Equal-height metric cards** — replaced the brittle `height: 100%` cascade
    with a `flex: 1 1 auto` propagation that's robust against Streamlit DOM
    changes (e.g. inserted `stVerticalBlock` wrappers).
- **System info card** in the sidebar — adopts Pragyam's `system-spec` markup
  with `.spec-row` / `.spec-label` / `.spec-value` flex layout (replaces the
  earlier `info-box` paragraph version).

### Changed
- **Convergence Analysis cards re-wired to the Unified Signal plot.** The four
  metric cards now show *exactly* what the Unified Signal plot rows display:
  - **NISHKARSH CONVICTION** ← normalized convergence (`norm_avg[-1]` in
    `[−1, +1]`), formatted `+0.42`. Signal classification re-thresholded for
    the new scale (`±0.3` moderate, `±0.5` strong).
  - **AARAMBH CONVICTION** ← `aarambh_ts["ConvictionRaw"]` (was
    `ConvictionBounded`), formatted `+0.42`.
  - **NIRNAY AVG SIGNAL** ← unchanged source, format upgraded from 1 to
    2 decimal places.
  - **AGREEMENT** ← unchanged.
- **Hero signal card** (`_render_primary_signal` in `app.py`) now reads the
  normalized value too. Interpretation paragraph rewritten to surface
  Aarambh and Nirnay contributions independently.
- **`render_nishkarsh_signal_card`** conviction format changed from `:+.0f`
  to `:+.2f` to render the new `[−1, +1]` scale meaningfully.
- **Sidebar masthead** typography tightened to match Pragyam exactly
  (`1.35rem` brand size, `0.04em` letter-spacing, `<hr>` divider instead of
  `.section-divider`).

### Removed
- **Stooq direct-yield endpoints.** Stooq started returning HTML error pages
  instead of CSV in late 2025, causing a cascade of `ParserError` retry
  loops. Replaced wholesale with the Global Macro yfinance universe.
- **`MACRO_SYMBOLS_STOOQ`** and dead **`MACRO_COLUMN_MAP`** removed from
  `core/config.py`.
- **`stooq_circuit`** breaker removed — no longer reachable.

### Fixed
- **DataFrame fragmentation `PerformanceWarning`** in `engines/nirnay.py` —
  two batches of column-by-column assignments (12 + 6 columns) collapsed into
  single `df.assign(...)` calls. `Series.shift(1)` replaced with
  `np.concatenate(([nan], arr[:-1]))` to keep behaviour byte-identical
  (verified on a 5-element test sequence).
- **Metric tooltip ring/dot misalignment** — the `::before` glow dot and the
  `.metric-tooltip` help-circle were both anchored at `top: var(--sp-3); right:
  var(--sp-3)`, but their centres differed by 3px each axis. Tooltip now has
  explicit `width/height: 12px` and adjusted position so the ring is
  concentric with the dot.
- **Header text alignment** inside metric cards — the equal-height flex rule
  was inadvertently forcing `flex-direction: column` on `<h4>`, which combined
  with the inherited `align-items: center` to horizontally centre the label.
  Narrowed the flex propagation selector to `div`-only descendants.
- **Sanskrit name on the landing page** — `.premium-header h1::after` content
  was still "प्रज्ञम" (left over from the Pragyam CSS port); corrected to
  "निष्कर्ष".

### Performance
- **Macro fetch concurrency** is now driven by yfinance's internal `threads=True`
  pool — one batch call for all 84 unique macro tickers (66 Global Macro +
  18 commodities/FX), one circuit hit, no manual `ThreadPoolExecutor` loop.

### Docs
- Module headers and version constants unified at **`v1.3.0`** across all
  35 Python files, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and the
  CHANGELOG.
- `data/cache.py`, `data/circuit_breaker.py`, and `convergence/normalization.py`
  carry full module-level docstrings explaining the lifecycle, state machine,
  and pipeline respectively.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-13 — *Obsidian Quant Terminal*

Full standardisation pass: module headers, documentation, and system integrity fixes.

### Added
- **Standardised module headers** across all 33 Python files. Every module now carries
  the `Nishkarsh v1.2.0` header with the निष्कर्ष tagline and a system-level description
  (AARAMBH, NIRNAY, CONVERGENCE, DATA, ANALYTICS, UI, CORE).
- **Structural break fallback** — `BaiPerronTest` is only in unreleased statsmodels 0.15+.
  A rolling-mean change-point heuristic is now used as a fallback when the native
  implementation is unavailable.

### Changed
- **UI aesthetic** rewritten as *"Obsidian Quant Terminal"* design language:
  - **Typography:** Syne (geometric, authoritative) for display, JetBrains Mono for data.
  - **Palette:** Obsidian (#0A0E17 → #050810), Amber Gold (#D4A853),
    Cyan (#22D3EE), Emerald (#34D399), Rose (#FB7185).
  - **Surfaces:** Frameless glass panels with thin border strokes.
  - **Plotly defaults** centralised in `ui/theme.py` — single source of truth for
    font, grid, hover, legend, and margin config across all tab renderers.
- **`VERSION` unified** — `ui/theme.py` VERSION corrected from `3.1.0` to `1.2.0`
  to match `core/config.py`. All module headers now reference `v1.2.0`.
- **`README.md`** rewritten from scratch with Obsidian Quant Terminal branding,
  full architecture diagram, pipeline flow, and troubleshooting section.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** restructured — removed legacy Aarambh-only version entries
  that predate the Nishkarsh unification.

### Fixed
- **statsmodels compatibility** — `BaiPerronTest` import no longer crashes on
  statsmodels 0.14.x. Graceful fallback to heuristic detection.
- **VERSION consistency** — `core/config.py` (`1.2.0`) and `ui/theme.py` (`3.1.0`)
  now both report `1.2.0`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-07 — *Nishkarsh Production Release*

The first release under the **Nishkarsh** name. Replaces the prior
"Samyoga" branding and ships the unified two-system convergence engine
end-to-end.

### Added
- **Unified Convergence Engine.** Two orthogonal systems (Aarambh top-down +
  Nirnay bottom-up) merged into a single convergence pipeline with adaptive
  4-dimension scoring (Direction 30% · Breadth 25% · Magnitude 25% · Regime 20%).
- **Cross-system divergence detection.** Three event types:
  - `AARAMBH_LEADS` — valuation extreme, constituents lagging (early warning).
  - `NIRNAY_LEADS` — momentum-first move (breadth turning before valuation).
  - `CONTRADICTION` — persistent disagreement (uncertain regime).
- **Terminal logging system** — direct console output with timed phases,
  per-constituent analysis logs, and formatted run summaries.
- **Progressive UI** — animated pulse-dot progress cards with gradient bar
  and real-time status during pipeline execution.
- **Nifty 50 constituent analysis.** All 50 symbols processed through
  MSF + MMR + the four-method regime ensemble (Adaptive Kalman / 3-state HMM /
  GARCH-like / CUSUM), aggregated to daily breadth statistics.
- **Macro data integration.** 18 yfinance commodities/FX symbols + 6 bond
  yields from Google Sheets = 24 macro indicators feeding the MMR regression.
- **Timeframe filtering.** 3M / 6M / 1Y / 2Y / ALL buttons with synchronised
  x-axis zoom across all convergence charts.
- **Hover templates.** All Plotly charts show date + value tooltips.

### Changed
- **System renamed** from *Samyoga* to **Nishkarsh** (निष्कर्ष — *"Conclusion"*).
  Complete branding update across every file.
- **Default timeframe** is now 6M (was 1Y); 3M added (replacing 1M).
- **Sigmoid formula** corrected to the original Nirnay form
  `2 / (1 + exp(−x / scale)) − 1` (was `2 / (1 + exp(−scale·x)) − 1`).
- **Market markers** on the unified signal plot now use conviction-plot-style
  markers (size 7/8/10 by signal strength, colour-coded green/red/grey).
- **Nirnay tab** completely rewritten to match the original Nirnay charts:
  oversold/overbought distribution, raw counts, buy/sell signal counts,
  HMM regime probabilities.

### Fixed
- **Stooq bond yields fallback.** Integrated Google Sheets bond yields
  (IN10Y / IN02Y / IN30Y / US10Y / US30Y / US02Y) when Stooq blocks
  automated access.
- **Column-name normalisation.** All Nirnay aggregation outputs use exact
  original column names (`Oversold_Pct`, `Overbought_Pct`, `Buy_Signals`, …).
- **Convergence date alignment.** Proper inner-join between Aarambh
  calendar dates and Nirnay trading dates.
- **Warning suppression.** Silenced yfinance, urllib3, pandas, and numpy
  warnings for clean terminal output.

### Removed
- All `Samyoga` branding references (sidebar, headers, signal cards,
  console output, metric cards).
- Progress-bar jargon — replaced with clean progress cards.
- Dead code paths from multi-phase development iterations.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-05 — *Initial Nishkarsh Release*

The first unified Nishkarsh release, inheriting the Aarambh-only lineage.

### Added
- **Aarambh FairValueEngine** — walk-forward ensemble regression (Ridge / Huber /
  OLS / ElasticNet / PCA-WLS) on Nifty 50 PE ratio with conformal prediction
  intervals and DDM smoothing.
- **Nirnay constituent engine** — per-stock MSF + MMR with four-method regime
  ensemble (Adaptive Kalman / 3-state HMM / GARCH-like / CUSUM).
- **Convergence cross-validator** — 4-dimension adaptive scoring with
  Drift-Diffusion filtering and divergence classification.
- **Streamlit UI** — five-tab interface with Obsidian Quant Terminal styling,
  timeframe filtering, and CSV export.
- **Google Sheets + yfinance data pipeline** — unified fetcher with TTL caching.
- **Nifty 50 live constituent fetching** from niftyindices.com with Wikipedia fallback.

### Inherited from Aarambh lineage (pre-unification)

The following mathematical foundations were hardened during the Aarambh-only
development cycle (versions 2.0.0–3.2.2) and carried forward:

- **True conformal quantiles** — empirical `compute_conformal_zscores` replacing
  pseudo-Gaussian z-scores.
- **Bai-Perron regime binding** — expanding windows bound to the most recent
  structural break.
- **DDM variance capping** — geometric variance scaling to prevent ballooning
  standard errors during prolonged regimes.
- **Andrews (1993) median-unbiased AR(1)** — jackknife correction for near-unit-root.
- **DFA Hurst exponent** — Peng et al. (1994) replacing biased R/S estimator.
- **Look-ahead bias elimination** — rolling mean/std with `shift(1)`.
- **Conviction soft bounds** — `tanh` transformation to `[−100, +100]`.
- **Thread-safe walk-forward** — lock-protected sequential execution.
