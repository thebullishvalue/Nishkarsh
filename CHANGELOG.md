## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-13 — *Obsidian Quant Terminal*

Full standardisation pass: module headers, documentation, and system integrity fixes.

### Added
- **Standardised module headers** across all 33 Python files. Every module now carries
  the `Nishkarsh v1.2.0` header with the निष्कर्ष tagline and a system-level description
  (AARAMBH, NIRNAY, CONVERGENCE, DATA, ANALYTICS, UI, CORE).
- **Structural break fallback** — `BaiPerronTest` is only in unreleased statsmodels 0.15+.
  A rolling-mean change-point heuristic is now used as a fallback when the native
  implementation is unavailable.

### Changed
- **UI aesthetic** rewritten as *"Obsidian Quant Terminal"* design language:
  - **Typography:** Syne (geometric, authoritative) for display, JetBrains Mono for data.
  - **Palette:** Obsidian (#0A0E17 → #050810), Amber Gold (#D4A853),
    Cyan (#22D3EE), Emerald (#34D399), Rose (#FB7185).
  - **Surfaces:** Frameless glass panels with thin border strokes.
  - **Plotly defaults** centralised in `ui/theme.py` — single source of truth for
    font, grid, hover, legend, and margin config across all tab renderers.
- **`VERSION` unified** — `ui/theme.py` VERSION corrected from `3.1.0` to `1.2.0`
  to match `core/config.py`. All module headers now reference `v1.2.0`.
- **`README.md`** rewritten from scratch with Obsidian Quant Terminal branding,
  full architecture diagram, pipeline flow, and troubleshooting section.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** restructured — removed legacy Aarambh-only version entries
  that predate the Nishkarsh unification.

### Fixed
- **statsmodels compatibility** — `BaiPerronTest` import no longer crashes on
  statsmodels 0.14.x. Graceful fallback to heuristic detection.
- **VERSION consistency** — `core/config.py` (`1.2.0`) and `ui/theme.py` (`3.1.0`)
  now both report `1.2.0`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-07 — *Nishkarsh Production Release*

The first release under the **Nishkarsh** name. Replaces the prior
"Samyoga" branding and ships the unified two-system convergence engine
end-to-end.

### Added
- **Unified Convergence Engine.** Two orthogonal systems (Aarambh top-down +
  Nirnay bottom-up) merged into a single convergence pipeline with adaptive
  4-dimension scoring (Direction 30% · Breadth 25% · Magnitude 25% · Regime 20%).
- **Cross-system divergence detection.** Three event types:
  - `AARAMBH_LEADS` — valuation extreme, constituents lagging (early warning).
  - `NIRNAY_LEADS` — momentum-first move (breadth turning before valuation).
  - `CONTRADICTION` — persistent disagreement (uncertain regime).
- **Terminal logging system** — direct console output with timed phases,
  per-constituent analysis logs, and formatted run summaries.
- **Progressive UI** — animated pulse-dot progress cards with gradient bar
  and real-time status during pipeline execution.
- **Nifty 50 constituent analysis.** All 50 symbols processed through
  MSF + MMR + the four-method regime ensemble (Adaptive Kalman / 3-state HMM /
  GARCH-like / CUSUM), aggregated to daily breadth statistics.
- **Macro data integration.** 18 yfinance commodities/FX symbols + 6 bond
  yields from Google Sheets = 24 macro indicators feeding the MMR regression.
- **Timeframe filtering.** 3M / 6M / 1Y / 2Y / ALL buttons with synchronised
  x-axis zoom across all convergence charts.
- **Hover templates.** All Plotly charts show date + value tooltips.

### Changed
- **System renamed** from *Samyoga* to **Nishkarsh** (निष्कर्ष — *"Conclusion"*).
  Complete branding update across every file.
- **Default timeframe** is now 6M (was 1Y); 3M added (replacing 1M).
- **Sigmoid formula** corrected to the original Nirnay form
  `2 / (1 + exp(−x / scale)) − 1` (was `2 / (1 + exp(−scale·x)) − 1`).
- **Market markers** on the unified signal plot now use conviction-plot-style
  markers (size 7/8/10 by signal strength, colour-coded green/red/grey).
- **Nirnay tab** completely rewritten to match the original Nirnay charts:
  oversold/overbought distribution, raw counts, buy/sell signal counts,
  HMM regime probabilities.

### Fixed
- **Stooq bond yields fallback.** Integrated Google Sheets bond yields
  (IN10Y / IN02Y / IN30Y / US10Y / US30Y / US02Y) when Stooq blocks
  automated access.
- **Column-name normalisation.** All Nirnay aggregation outputs use exact
  original column names (`Oversold_Pct`, `Overbought_Pct`, `Buy_Signals`, …).
- **Convergence date alignment.** Proper inner-join between Aarambh
  calendar dates and Nirnay trading dates.
- **Warning suppression.** Silenced yfinance, urllib3, pandas, and numpy
  warnings for clean terminal output.

### Removed
- All `Samyoga` branding references (sidebar, headers, signal cards,
  console output, metric cards).
- Progress-bar jargon — replaced with clean progress cards.
- Dead code paths from multi-phase development iterations.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-05 — *Initial Nishkarsh Release*

The first unified Nishkarsh release, inheriting the Aarambh-only lineage.

### Added
- **Aarambh FairValueEngine** — walk-forward ensemble regression (Ridge / Huber /
  OLS / ElasticNet / PCA-WLS) on Nifty 50 PE ratio with conformal prediction
  intervals and DDM smoothing.
- **Nirnay constituent engine** — per-stock MSF + MMR with four-method regime
  ensemble (Adaptive Kalman / 3-state HMM / GARCH-like / CUSUM).
- **Convergence cross-validator** — 4-dimension adaptive scoring with
  Drift-Diffusion filtering and divergence classification.
- **Streamlit UI** — five-tab interface with Obsidian Quant Terminal styling,
  timeframe filtering, and CSV export.
- **Google Sheets + yfinance data pipeline** — unified fetcher with TTL caching.
- **Nifty 50 live constituent fetching** from niftyindices.com with Wikipedia fallback.

### Inherited from Aarambh lineage (pre-unification)

The following mathematical foundations were hardened during the Aarambh-only
development cycle (versions 2.0.0–3.2.2) and carried forward:

- **True conformal quantiles** — empirical `compute_conformal_zscores` replacing
  pseudo-Gaussian z-scores.
- **Bai-Perron regime binding** — expanding windows bound to the most recent
  structural break.
- **DDM variance capping** — geometric variance scaling to prevent ballooning
  standard errors during prolonged regimes.
- **Andrews (1993) median-unbiased AR(1)** — jackknife correction for near-unit-root.
- **DFA Hurst exponent** — Peng et al. (1994) replacing biased R/S estimator.
- **Look-ahead bias elimination** — rolling mean/std with `shift(1)`.
- **Conviction soft bounds** — `tanh` transformation to `[−100, +100]`.
- **Thread-safe walk-forward** — lock-protected sequential execution.
